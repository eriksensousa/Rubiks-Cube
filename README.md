<h1> Rubik’s Cube in Python </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2> 

Rubik’s Cube is a popular 3D puzzle game that has been enjoyed by people of all ages for decades. With the rise of computer science and programming, it is now possible to simulate and solve the Rubik’s Cube using code. In this project, we will explore how to create a Rubik’s Cube simulator and solver using the Python programming language.

<h2> Background </h2>  

There are several libraries and frameworks available in Python that can help you build a Rubik’s Cube simulator and solver. For example, the rubiks-cube library on PyPI implements a 3x3x3 Rubik’s Cube for general purpose in Python1. It provides a Rubik’s Cube implemented using numpy arrays with a function to turn the cube faces, as you would turn a real cube, and a function to apply a scramble as a string in the official WCA format1.

<h2> Methodology </h2> 

To create a Rubik’s Cube simulator and solver using Python, you can follow these steps:

1. Set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies, such as the rubiks-cube library.
2. Create a working command-line Rubik’s Cube simulator using the rubiks-cube library.
3. Implement a solver algorithm to solve the Rubik’s Cube.
4. Use a library like Pygame to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the Rubik’s Cube simulator and solver2.

<h2> Results </h2>

By following these steps, you will be able to create a fully functional Rubik’s Cube simulator and solver using Python. You can use this project to learn more about algorithms, data structures, and graphical user interfaces in Python.

<h2> Conclusion</h2>

In conclusion, creating a Rubik’s Cube simulator and solver using Python is an interesting and challenging project that can help you improve your programming skills. By using libraries like rubiks-cube and Pygame, you can easily create a working Rubik’s Cube simulator and solver in Python.
